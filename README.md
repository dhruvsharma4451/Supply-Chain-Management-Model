Supply Chain Management Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts supply chain metrics using machine learning algorithms to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making. By leveraging a dataset containing various supply chain features, the project explores patterns and builds predictive models to address key business questions.

Technologies Used
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
Visualization: Heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, line plots and pie charts.

Instructions to Use
1. Install required libraries using:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
3. Run the Python script to preprocess data, explore patterns, and train models.
4. Visualizations and model performance metrics will be displayed.
